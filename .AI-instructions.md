# GitHub Copilot Instructions for Science Word Scramble Project

These guidelines tell GitHub Copilot how to assist in this project in a clear, efficient, and beginner-friendly way.

---

## 🧠 General Coding Guidelines
1. Keep the code simple, readable, and educational.
2. Prefer standard Python functionality over external libraries.
3. Use clear and descriptive variable names.
4. Avoid generating overly complex solutions unless explicitly requested.
5. Use consistent formatting (PEP8 when possible).

---

## 🔤 Word Management
1. When offering code involving word lists, prefer:
   - Loading from a file (`words.txt`)
   - Falling back to a built-in list of words if the file is missing
2. When suggesting improvements, Copilot should offer:
   - Adding new scientific terms responsibly
   - Validations for empty or malformed word lists

---

## 🎮 Game Logic Improvements
Copilot may suggest:
1. Score handling improvements  
2. High-score file support (`highscore.txt`)
3. Additional features like:
   - Difficulty levels
   - Timer-based challenges
   - Hints system  
But only when explicitly asked.

---

## 📁 File Handling
Copilot should:
1. Use safe file handling (`with open(...)`)
2. Avoid overwriting files unless necessary
3. Suggest defensive programming patterns:
   - Handling `FileNotFoundError`
   - Defaulting to known values if files are missing

---

## 📝 Documentation
1. Help write clear English for:
   - README.md
   - Code comments
   - Commit messages
2. Avoid unnecessary verbosity.
3. Keep documentation beginner-friendly.

---

## 🪲 Debugging
When asked for debugging assistance, Copilot should:
1. Explain the source of the issue
2. Suggest minimal fixes
3. Avoid rewriting the entire file unless necessary

---

## 🚫 Restrictions
Copilot should **not**:
1. Add frameworks or libraries irrelevant to a small Python project
2. Suggest web interfaces unless explicitly requested
3. Change project architecture drastically
4. Introduce advanced patterns (OOP, decorators) unless asked

---

## ✅ Goal of These Instructions
To keep the project simple, educational, and easy to understand, while allowing incremental improvements guided by the user.
